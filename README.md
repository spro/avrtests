Simple AVR C projects with the ATMega328p and ATTiny85

* [blink](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/blink)
  Just a blinking LED.

* [analog-blinkrate](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/analog-blinkrate)
  Reads a potentiometer to set the delay time for some LEDs blinking.

* [analog-nightlight](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/analog-nightlight)
  Measures light with a photoresistor and makes more light when it's dark.

* [fading-rgb](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/fading-rgb)
  Smoothly transitioning between colors of an RGB LED with PWM.

* [fading-rgb-true](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/fading-rgb-true)
  Same result as above with "real" PWM using onboard timers.

* [rgb-uart](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/rgb-uart)
  Listens for characters over 2400 baud UART and displays a color based on an incoming character.

* [fading-rgb-uart](https://github.com/spro/learning-avrc/tree/master/fading-rgb-uart)
  Combines UART and soft PWM to fade between colors by character.
